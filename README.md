## All Questions

### 1. Put the scripts in the right order of execution

- A. `<script async src="async1.js" />` (loads in **300ms**)
- B. `<script defer src="defer1.js" />` (loads in **200ms**)
- C. `<script defer src="defer2.js" />` (loads in **300ms**)
- D. `<script async src="async2.js" />` (loads in **50ms**)
- E. `<script async defer src="asyncdefer1.js" />` (loads in **60ms**)

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />
 The order of execution depends on whether the scripts are loaded using the "async" or "defer" attribute. Here is the correct order of execution:

- D. `<script async src="async2.js" />` (loads in 50ms)
- E. `<script async defer src="asyncdefer1.js" />` (loads in 60ms)
- A. `<script async src="async1.js" />` (loads in 300ms)
- B. `<script defer src="defer1.js" />` (loads in 200ms)
- C. `<script defer src="defer2.js" />` (loads in 300ms)

Explanation:

- D. `<script async src="async2.js" />` (loads in 50ms)
  - This script has the "async" attribute, so it will be loaded asynchronously(HTML parser will continue parsing HTML) and will execute as soon as it's downloaded. It loads in 50ms.

- E. `<script async defer src="asyncdefer1.js" />` (loads in 60ms)
  - This script has both "async" and "defer" attributes. It will be loaded asynchronously and will execute in the order it appears in the HTML. It loads in 60ms, which is faster than the deferred scripts.

- A. `<script async src="async1.js" />` (loads in 300ms)
  - This script has the "async" attribute, so it will be loaded asynchronously and will execute as soon as it's downloaded. It loads in 300ms.

- B. `<script defer src="defer1.js" />` (loads in 200ms)
  - This script has the "defer" attribute, meaning it will be loaded asynchronously but will wait for the HTML parsing to complete before executing. It loads in 200ms.

- B. `<script defer src="defer2.js" />` (loads in 300ms)
  - Similar to the previous script, it has the "defer" attribute. It loads in 300ms.

Putting it all together, the correct order of execution is "D -> E -> A -> B -> C" based on the loading times and the attributes associated with each script.

### 2. Which statements are true?

- A. The render tree contains all elements from the DOM and CSSOM combined
- B. Compositing is the process of separating layers based on z-index, which are then combined to form the final image displayed on the screen
- C. The layout process assigns colors and images to the visual elements in the render tree
- D. The composting process happens on the compositor thread
- E. Elements that aren't visible on the page, for example `display: hidden`, aren't part of the DOM tree

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

- D. The compositing process happens on the compositor thread.

Explanation:

- A. The render tree contains only the visible elements from the **DOM** and **CSSOM** combined. It does not include hidden or non-visible elements.

- B. Compositing is the process of combining layers, taking into account properties like z-index to determine the stacking order of these layers. It doesn't inherently separate layers based on z-index; instead, it considers the stacking context and order when combining them to form the final image displayed on the screen.

- C. The layout process involves determining the position and size of each element. Assigning colors and images to visual elements is part of the **painting process**.

- D. Compositing typically happens on a separate thread called the compositor thread to improve performance.

- E. Elements with `display: none` or similar properties are not part of the **render tree** and, consequently, are not visible on the page. But they are part of the **DOM tree**.

### 3. Fill in the gaps

```
- Browser sends request to [A]
- [A] queries [B]
- [B] responds with [C] IP address
- [A] queries [C]
- [C] responds with [D] IP address
- [A] queries [D]
- [D] responds with website's [E]
```

1. Recursive DNS Resolver
2. Root Name Server
3. IP Address
4. Top Level Domain Name Server
5. Authoritative Name Server

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

```
- Browser sends request to [1] Recursive DNS Resolver
- [1] Recursive DNS resolver queries [2] Root Name Server
- [2] Root Name Server responds with [4] Top Level Domain Name Server IP address
- [1] Recursive DNS Resolver queries [4] Top Level Domain Name Server
- [4] Top Level Domain Name Server responds with [5] Authoritative Name Server IP address
- [1] Recursive DNS Resolver queries [5] Authoritative Name Server
- [5] Authoritative Name Server responds with website's [3] IP Address
```

Explanation:

1. **Browser sends request to [1] Recursive DNS Resolver:**
   - When you type a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into your browser, the browser sends a DNS resolution request to a Recursive DNS Resolver.

2. **[1] Recursive DNS resolver queries [2] Root Name Server:**
   - The Recursive DNS Resolver queries the Root Name Server to obtain information about the Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server responsible for the domain.

3. **[2] Root Name Server responds with [4] Top Level Domain Name Server IP address:**
   - The Root Name Server responds with the IP address of the Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server responsible for the specific domain.

4. **[1] Recursive DNS Resolver queries [4] Top Level Domain Name Server:**
   - The Recursive DNS Resolver then queries the Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server to get information about the Authoritative Name Server responsible for the domain.

5. **[4] Top Level Domain Name Server responds with [5] Authoritative Name Server IP address:**
   - The Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server responds with the IP address of the Authoritative Name Server that has the specific domain's DNS records.

6. **[1] Recursive DNS Resolver queries [5] Authoritative Name Server:**
   - The Recursive DNS Resolver queries the Authoritative Name Server for the IP address associated with the domain.

7. **[5] Authoritative Name Server responds with website's [3] IP Address:**
   - Finally, the Authoritative Name Server responds with the IP address of the requested domain, allowing the Recursive DNS Resolver to provide this information to the browser.

In summary, the Recursive DNS Resolver iteratively queries the necessary DNS servers, starting from the Root Name Server, then the Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server, and finally the Authoritative Name Server, until it obtains the IP address associated with the domain. This process allows the browser to connect to the correct server and retrieve the web content for the specified domain.

### 4. What gets logged?

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log(1));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));
Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(3)));
new Promise(() => console.log(4));
setTimeout(() => console.log(5));
```

- A. `1` `2` `3` `4` `5`
- B. `1` `5` `2` `4` `3`
- C. `3` `2` `4` `1` `5`
- D. `4` `2` `1` `5` `3`
- E. `2` `4` `3` `1` `5`

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

- **D. `4` `2` `1` `5` `3`**

Explanation:

![Event Loop](assets/event-loop.gif)

1. `setTimeout(() => console.log(1));`: This is scheduled to run in a future tick of the event loop. It goes into the callback queue.

2. `Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));`: This promise is resolved immediately, and `console.log(2)` is scheduled as a microtask.

3. `Promise.resolve().then(() => setTimeout(() => console.log(3)));`: This is resolved immediately, and the inner `setTimeout` is scheduled for a future tick. Both are put into the microtask queue.

4. `new Promise(() => console.log(4));`: The executor function inside the promise is executed synchronously. Therefore, it immediately logs `4`.

5. `setTimeout(() => console.log(5));`: This is scheduled to run in a future tick. It goes into the callback queue.

Now, let's look at the order of execution:

1. `console.log(4)` is executed immediately because the promise executor runs synchronously.

2. **Microtasks:**
   1. `console.log(2)` is executed (from the first round of the event loop).
   2. `setTimeout(()=>console.log(3))` is scheduled as a microtask, and its callback is queued for a future tick as macrotask.

3. **Callback Queue (Task Queue/ Macrotask queue):**
   1. `console.log(1)` (from the second round of the event loop, scheduled by setTimeout).
   2. `console.log(5)` (from the third round of the event loop, scheduled by setTimeout).
   3. `console.log(3)` (the callback from the second microtask, invoked by the resolved promise).

### 5. Match the resource hints with their definitions

- A. `dns-prefetch`
- B. `preconnect`
- C. `prefetch`
- D. `preload`

1. prioritizes fetching of critical resources needed for the current navigation
2. performs domain name resolution in the background
3. proactively performs DNS resolution and TCP/TLS handshake
4. requests non-critical resources in the background

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

- A. `dns-prefetch`: **2.** performs domain name resolution in the background
- B. `preconnect`: **3.** proactively performs DNS resolution and TCP/TLS handshake
- C. `prefetch`: **4.** requests non-critical resources in the background
- D. `preload`: **1.** prioritizes fetching of critical resources needed for the current navigation

Explanation:

![Network](assets/network.png)

- A. `dns-prefetch`: This resource hint is used to perform domain name resolution in the background. It helps in resolving the DNS of a domain before the user clicks on a link, reducing the latency when the link is clicked.

- B. `preconnect`: This resource hint is used to proactively perform DNS resolution, TCP handshake, and TLS negotiation with a remote server. It sets up early connections to important third-party origins, helping to reduce the latency when actual requests are made.

- C. `prefetch`: This resource hint is used to request non-critical resources in the background. It fetches and caches resources that might be needed for future navigation, improving the overall performance by preloading resources that are likely to be used.

- D. `preload`: This resource hint is used to prioritize the fetching of critical resources needed for the current navigation. It allows you to declare resources that should be fetched and cached as a high priority, ensuring that essential assets are available quickly when needed.

In summary:

- `dns-prefetch`: Performs domain name resolution in the background.
- `preconnect`: Proactively performs DNS resolution, TCP handshake, and TLS negotiation.
- `prefetch`: Requests non-critical resources in the background.
- `preload`: Prioritizes fetching of critical resources needed for the current navigation.

### 6. What's the output?

```js
const member = { 
  name: "Jane", 
  address: { street: "101 Main St" }
};
const member2 = { ...member };
member.address.street = "102 Main St";
member.name = "Sarah";

console.log(member2);
```

- A. `{ name: "Jane", address: { street: "101 Main St" }}`
- B. `{ name: "Jane", address: { street: "102 Main St" }}`
- C. `{ name: "Sarah", address: { street: "101 Main St" }}`
- D. `{ name: "Sarah", address: { street: "102 Main St" }}`

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

**B. `{ name: "Jane", address: { street: "102 Main St" }}`**

Explanation:

<img src="assets/reference-destructuring.png" width="600px">

1. `member` has a nested object `address`.
2. `member2` is created using the spread operator, performing a shallow copy.
3. Changing `member.address.street` also affects `member2.address.street` because it's a shallow copy.
4. Changing `member.name` doesn't affect `member2.name` since it's a primitive property, and the spread operator creates a new reference for primitive types.

### 7. Put the `PerformanceNavigationTimings` in the right order

- A. `loadEventStart`
- B. `domComplete`
- C. `domContentLoadedEventStart`
- D. `fetchStart`
- E. `connectEnd`
- F. `domInteractive`

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

- D. `fetchStart`
- E. `connectEnd`
- F. `domInteractive`
- C. `domContentLoadedEventStart`
- B. `domComplete`
- A. `loadEventStart`

Explanation:

1. **D. `fetchStart`**: This marks the beginning of the navigation process when the browser starts fetching the resource. It represents the start time of the navigation.

2. **E. `connectEnd`**: This is the time when the last byte of the response is received or the connection is closed. It indicates the end of the connection phase in the navigation.

3. **F. `domInteractive`**: This marks the point in time when the HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed, and the browser begins loading sub-resources like scripts and stylesheets. It is an important milestone in the loading process.

4. **C. `domContentLoadedEventStart`**: This is the time when the DOM content is fully loaded and parsed, and the DOMContentLoaded event begins. This event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

5. **B. `domComplete`**: This represents the time when the HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed, and all sub-resources like images and stylesheets have finished loading. It marks the point when the `load` event can be fired.

6. **A. `loadEventStart`**: This is the time when the load event for the page is fired. It signifies that all resources on the page, including images and scripts, have been loaded.

</details>

### 8. Match the caching directives to their definitions

- A. `no-cache`
- B. `must-revalidate`
- C. `no-store`
- D. `private`
- E. `stale-while-revalidate`

1. validates a stale response with the origin server before using it
2. serves stale content while validating the cached response with the origin server
3. doesn't cache any part of the request or response
4. validates a cached response with the origin server before using it, even if it is still fresh
5. prevents caching on shared caches

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 <br />

- A. `no-cache`: **4.** validates a cached response with the origin server before using it, even if it is still fresh
- B. `must-revalidate`: **1.** validates a stale response with the origin server before using it
- C. `no-store`: **3.** doesn't cache any part of the request or response
- D. `private`: **5.** prevents caching on shared caches
- E. `stale-while-revalidate`: **2.** serves stale content while validating the cached response with the origin server

Explanation:

![Cache flowchart](assets/cache-flowchart.png)

- A. `no-cache`: This directive indicates that a cached response must be validated with the origin server before it is used, even if the cached response is still considered fresh. It doesn't mean that the resource won't be cached; instead, it requires validation before reuse.

- B. `must-revalidate`: This directive requires that a cached response, even if stale, must be revalidated with the origin server before it is used. If the validation fails, the cache must fetch the resource from the server.

- C. `no-store`: This directive instructs caches (both private and shared) not to store any part of the request or response. The content must be obtained from the origin server for every request.

- D. `private`: This directive indicates that the response is intended for a single user and should not be stored in shared caches. It is specific to a particular user and is typically used for sensitive information.

- E. `stale-while-revalidate`: This is an extension to the Cache-Control header. It allows the serving of stale content to the user while asynchronously revalidating the cache in the background. It helps improve performance by not making the user wait for a new response.

### 9. What statements are true about this code block?  

```js
function addMember(name) {
  return { name, createdAt: Date.now() }
}

let obj1 = addMember("John");
let obj2 = addMember("Sarah");

obj1.friend = obj2;
obj2.friend = obj1;

obj1 = null;
obj2 = null;  
```

- A. `obj1` and `obj2` cannot be garbage collected, leading to a memory leak
- B. `obj1` and `obj2` will be garbage collected immediately after setting them to `null`
- C. `obj1` and `obj2` will only be garbage collected after closing the browser tab
- D. `obj1` and `obj2` can be garbage collected during the next garbage collection cycle

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<br />

**D. `obj1` and `obj2` can be garbage collected during the next garbage collection cycle**

Explanation:

In JavaScript, when an object is no longer reachable or referenced, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. In this code block:

1. `obj1` and `obj2` are initially assigned objects created by the `addMember` function.
2. Both `obj1` and `obj2` have a circular reference, as `obj1.friend` points to `obj2` and `obj2.friend` points to `obj1`.
3. When `obj1` and `obj2` are set to `null`, there are no direct references to the objects they were pointing to.
4. However, since there is a circular reference between the objects themselves, the garbage collector needs to identify and break the circular reference to determine that the objects are unreachable.

JavaScript engines use automatic garbage collection to identify and collect unreachable objects. The exact timing of garbage collection is implementation-specific and depends on the JavaScript engine. Generally, it occurs during the next garbage collection cycle.

So, `obj1` and `obj2` can be garbage collected during the next garbage collection cycle, breaking the circular reference and freeing up the memory.

### 10. When animating the following properties, which have the correctly listed rendering costs?

- A. `width`: Layout, Paint, Composite
- B. `opacity`: Paint, Composite
- C. `background-image`: Composite
- D. `left`: Layout, Paint, Composite
- E. `transform`: Paint, Composite

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<br />

- A. `width`: Layout, Paint, Composite
- D. `left`: Layout, Paint, Composite

Explanation:

- A. `width`: **Layout, Paint, Composite**
  - **Layout (Reflow):** Changing the width of an element affects its box model, and a reflow is triggered to recalculate the layout.
  - **Paint (Repaint):** The change in width may require repainting the affected area of the element.
  - **Composite:** After layout and paint, the rendered layers are composited to display the final result.

- B. `opacity`: **Composite**
  - **Composite:** Changing the opacity of an element often doesn't require a repaint, but the compositor can directly blend the element with the underlying layers.

- C. `background-image`: **Paint, Composite**
  - **Paint (Repaint):** If a change in the background image affects the appearance of the element, it may require repainting.
  - **Composite:** After painting, the rendered layers are composited to display the final result.

- D. `left`: **Layout, Paint, Composite**
  - **Layout (Reflow):** Adjusting the left position of an element affects its positioning in the layout, triggering a reflow.
  - **Paint (Repaint):** Repainting may be necessary if the left position change affects the appearance of the element.
  - **Composite:** After layout and paint, the rendered layers are composited to display the final result.

- E. `transform`: **Composite**
  - **Composite:** Transformations like scaling, rotation, etc., are often handled directly by the compositor without the need for a repaint.

In summary:

- A. `width`: **Layout, Paint, Composite**
- B. `opacity`: **Composite**
- C. `background-image`: **Paint, Composite**
- D. `left`: **Layout, Paint, Composite**
- E. `transform`: **Composite**

- C. `B` `D` `E` `F` `G` `C` `A`
- D. `A` `C` `G` `F`
- E. `A` `C` `G` `F` `D` `E`

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<br />

- E. `A` `C` `G` `F` `D` `E`

Explanation:

![Event Flow](assets/eventflow.svg)

- A. `A` is logged when the click event reaches the outer element during the capturing phase (`true`).
- C. `C` is logged when the click event reaches the inner element during the capturing phase (`true`).
- G. `G` is logged when the click event reaches the button during the capturing phase (`true`).
- F. `F` is logged when the click event reaches the button during the bubbling phase (`false` or omitted, defaulting to bubbling).
- D. `D` is logged inside the click event handler for the `inner` element.
- E. `E` is logged after `D` because `e.stopPropagation()` stops further propagation.
